        <p>I attended my first GeekDinner (the <a href="http://wiki.geekdinner.org.za/wiki/Johannesburg_June_2008">second one in JHB</a>) this weekend. It was more of a &quot;GeekLunch&quot;, starting at 14:00 in the afternoon, although some people hung around until late that night. The venue was Yusuf&#39;s house, with his wife Shehnaaz providing the awesome food. I arrived just after 14:00, one of the first to arrive, and the others trickled in over the course of the next hour or so. Yusuf was up first, speaking about the pervasive problems with <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/">CSS</a>, and how in many ways it represents a step sideways or backwards relative to what came before it. I went next, slidelessly rambling on a bit about the history of scale in computing, before moving on to a more detailed description of the scaling architecture we&#39;ve chosen to employ for our application. We broke for lunch then, and then resumed with <a href="http://singe.za.net/blog/">Dominic</a> talking about CSRF/XSS attacks, browser hijacking, and ways to protect yourself against the aforementioned. That brought the presentations to an end (they were each about 30 minutes long), but everyone stayed for a while, hung out / chatted, and generally had a good time.</p><p>The atmosphere was very relaxed and friendly, and with such a small group it was easy to take questions from the audience, so none of the presentations turned into a complete monologue. This was my first time presenting tech-related material like this, and I hadn&#39;t really prepared (I only volunteered on the mailing list a few days before the event); I don&#39;t think I did too badly, but some pretty slides and more preparation would have been nice. Answering questions from the audience was awesome, though; it&#39;s always good to know you haven&#39;t completely lost everyone.</p><p>All in all, it looks like we&#39;re definitely on-track for a thriving GeekDinner JHB event; I think the key will be to let things evolve naturally, rather than trying to shoehorn things forcibly into a canned recipe provided by someone else.<br /></p>
