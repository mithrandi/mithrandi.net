        <p>Divmod Mantissa is an &quot;application server&quot; which I&#39;ve been basing almost all of my applications on for a while now; this IRC conversation snippet is pretty illustrative of why I think Mantissa (and the rest of the stack, Twisted etc.) rocks.</p><blockquote><p><strong>&lt; glyph</strong><strong>&gt;</strong> oubiwann: I think I&#39;ve put my finger on why I don&#39;t like the serious use of acronyms like AJAX and LAMP<br /><strong>&lt; glyph&gt;</strong> oubiwann: they&#39;re just shibboleths for much simpler concepts<br /><strong>&lt; oubiwann&gt;</strong> glyph: why&#39;s that?<br /><strong>&lt; glyph&gt;</strong> oubiwann: AJAX is the magic word that means &quot;Hey guys! Check this out! Javascript works now!&quot;<br /><strong></strong><strong>&lt; glyph&gt;</strong> LAMP is the magic words that means &quot;Hey uh, did you guys notice that PHP is almost completely broken without being attached to a database on the back end and a web server on the front end?&quot;<br /><strong>&lt; glyph&gt;</strong> &quot;AJAX&quot; apps are Javascript apps, &quot;LAMP&quot; apps are PHP apps<br /><strong>&lt; glyph&gt;</strong> there&#39;s no additional information conveyed by the acronym, because all the peripheral crap that is pulled in doesn&#39;t make a difference<br /><strong>&lt; glyph&gt;</strong> lots of &quot;LAMP&quot; applications actually use postgres, or run on freebsd<br /><strong>&lt; glyph&gt;</strong> oubiwann: the reason we had so much trouble with *MAP, META, etc, is that there&#39;s actually no peripheral crap in our universe<br /><strong>&lt; glyph&gt;</strong> it&#39;s all part of the stack ;)</p></blockquote>
