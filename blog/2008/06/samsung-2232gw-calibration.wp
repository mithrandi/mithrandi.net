        <p>I just purchased a <a href="http://spyder.datacolor.com/product-mc-s3elite.php">Spyder 3 Elite</a>. The main reason I wanted one of these was to calibrate my Samsung 2232GW LCD monitor, as the one I have has an AU Optronics (aka &quot;A&quot;) panel with a decidedly blue colour cast. Having successfully calibrated the display, I am quite pleased with the results, so I&#39;m posting my colour profile here for others who aren&#39;t quite willing to splurge on a Spyder 3 or similar calibration device. If you have an AUO panel, my profile should work reasonably well for you: <a href="http://mithrandi.net/files/Samsung%20SyncMaster%202232GW%20A%20Internet.icm">Samsung SyncMaster 2232GW A Internet.icm</a></p><div></div><p>Select the &quot;Internet&quot; preset on the monitor (down-arrow OSD menu) before loading this colour profile, as I calibrated from that preset; the default preset is just too bright for me. To find out which panel you have, you need to access the service menu: first lower contrast and brightness to 0, go into the main OSD menu, then hold the &quot;Source&quot; button for about five seconds. Now look at the last three letters in the &quot;Version&quot; field; if the middle letter is &quot;L&quot; (eg. my panel is &quot;CLA&quot;), then it is an AU Optronics panel. For reference, the other panel manufacturerers are &quot;A&quot; for Samsung (which should be almost perfect out of the box), &quot;D&quot; for CMO / Chimei (which apparently has an even worse blue cast that can&#39;t be calibrated away), and &quot;I&quot; for CPT (which I have no information about).</p>
