         <p>Haven&#39;t posted for a while; guess I&#39;ve been too busy. Had to reinstall Windows Vista on my laptop this weekend; I was going to post a whole long rant about it, but honestly, I can&#39;t work up the aggravation over Windows anymore... the only thing I use it for these days is running <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/index.html">Photoshop</a>, <a href="http://www.blizzard.com/us/war3x/">Warcraft III</a>, and <a href="http://www.eve-online.com/">EVE</a>. Anyhow, just so this post isn&#39;t a complete waste of space and time, I ran across this awesome quote again today:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;I have come to believe that the whole world is an enigma, a harmless enigma<br />&#160;that is made terrible by our own mad attempt to interpret it as though it had<br />&#160;an underlying truth.&quot;<br />&#160; -- Umberto Eco</p></blockquote>
