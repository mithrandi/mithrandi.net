        <p>I was inspired by <a href="http://singe.za.net/blog/archives/944-Political-Compass-2008.html">Dom&#39;s post</a> to finally get around to retaking this test, with the following results:</p><p>Economic Left/Right: 5.62<br />

Social Libertarian/Authoritarian: -6.36</p><p>My previous results (care of Spinach):</p><p></p><pre>&lt;+Spinach&gt; mithrandi.political_compass is 7.25/-6.31 (2006/01/10), 5.88/-5.95 (2004/06/22)<br /></pre><p>Interesting that my views seem to have swung in a similar pattern to his, over time; perhaps it was the test that changed, not our views? I&#39;m somewhat confused in the left-wards swing in my Economic score, since I don&#39;t think that&#39;s an accurate representation of my actual viewpoint. As before, I was left with a fair amount of dissatisfaction with many of the questions, as I was not able to adequately represent my views on a particular subject through the limited options available.<br /></p>
