        <blockquote><p>On two occasions I have been asked, â€“ &quot;Pray, Mr. Babbage, if you put

into the machine wrong figures, will the right answers come out?&quot; In

one case a member of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Lords" title="House of Lords">Upper</a>, and in the other a member of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Commons_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="House of Commons of the United Kingdom">Lower</a> House put this question. I am not able rightly to apprehend the kind of confusion of ideas that could provoke such a question.<br />-- <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Babbage">Charles Babbage</a>, FRS (1864)<br /></p></blockquote><p>Nearly 150 years later, I continue to be just as confused as the esteemed Mr Babbage.<br /></p>
