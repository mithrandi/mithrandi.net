         <p>Manoj Srivastava, Debian Project Secretary since April 2001, <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-vote/2008/12/msg00275.html">has resigned</a>.</p><p>I&#39;d like to disclose up front that I am not (<a href="https://nm.debian.org/nmstatus.php?email=mithrandi%40mithrandi.za.net">yet</a>) a Debian Developer, but I have been involved with the project for quite a few years now, initially as a user, then later as <a href="http://qa.debian.org/developer.php?login=mithrandi@mithrandi.net">maintainer and co-maintainer</a> of <a href="http://qa.debian.org/developer.php?login=mithrandi@mithrandi.za.net">various packages</a>.</p><p>Throughout my involvement with the project, I have continued to be impressed by Manoj&#39;s conduct, both in his personal capacity, and in his official capacity as Project Secretary and the duties that form part of that position (mainly running votes). Up until recently, I had thought that the rest of the project held a similar view, but apparently certain individuals disagree.</p><p>Whatever disagreements anyone might have with how Manoj has handled certain votes, I don&#39;t think someone that has faithfully served the project for nearly 9 years deserves this kind of personal, in-your-face vitriol; if you don&#39;t like the way someone is doing their job, there are far more constructive ways of expressing your disagreement than burning them at the stake, and I am ashamed to be associated with any individuals who were involved in this. I know there are many others who share my respect for Manoj, despite disliking some of the decisions he has made; they&#39;re capable of disagreeing without resorting to personal attacks, so this clearly isn&#39;t impossible.</p><p>Manoj (if you ever read this), I hope this whole affair has not caused you too much personal pain or anguish; please know that many of us out here have nothing but respect for the time and effort you&#39;ve donated to the project, and I wish you well in your future efforts, wherever they may lie.<br /></p>
