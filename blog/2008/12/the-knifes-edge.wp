         <p>[And now, for something slightly different...]</p><blockquote><p>And in my darkest moment, fetal and weeping;<br />the Moon tells me Her secret, my confidant:</p><p>&quot;As full and bright as I am,<br />this light is not my own,<br />a million light reflections,<br />pass over me.</p><p>The source is bright and endless,<br />She resuscitates the hopeless;<br />without Her we are lifeless satellites,<br />drifting.&quot;</p><p>— Tool, <em>Reflection</em></p></blockquote><p>Aryn paused at the entrance to the courtyard; Jaræd, who was leading the squad, had stopped, his head cocked to the side. Aryn glanced at the young lanky Truthseeker in annoyance; his magesense told him there was nothing in the courtyard, and their quarry was fleeing swiftly as they dithered here. &quot;What is it now?!&quot; he snapped, then froze as Jaræd whipped his head around to fix him with an icy stare from his grey eyes; the rest of his protest died unvoiced, as an icy chill ran down his spine. The Truthseeker held his gaze for a few moments, then turned away again, staring distractedly into the distance.</p><p>Aryn fumed silently. The 28 year-old mage was in his final year of apprenticeship; and as the favoured apprentice to Master Kæia of the Tower, his prestige was greater than some Master Wizards in the region. He had displayed a remarkable aptitude for the arcane arts; this, combined with his impressively high capacity for drawing on the Weave had soon caught the eye of Master Kæia, and she had taken him on as an apprentice. He had quickly learned that her reputation for being a relentless and demanding Master was well-deserved, but nevertheless he flourished in this environment, rapidly surpassing his peers in magical ability.</p><p>Thus, when the assignment to capture a rogue wizard was handed down to his squad, he had been baffled and dismayed by his orders. Little was known about the Truthseekers, save that they came from some distant part of the Northern Kingdom, but none of them showed even a hint of magical ability, and it was widely believed amongst mages that they were nothing more than con-men and fraudsters. And now, his orders stipulated that a Truthseeker was to lead the pursuit? His protest was disregarded, and he knew better than to disobey a direct order, but this damned trickster was going to be the death of them all!</p><p>Aryn&#39;s musings were interrupted as the Truthseeker turned to address him again.<br /></p><p>&quot;There is a trap in the courtyard ahead; wait here while I neutralize it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What? I&#39;ve scanned the whole courtyard, there is nothing there!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Wait here, Mage, or you will soon discover the limits of your Magic the hard way.&quot;</p><p>With that cryptic comment, Jaræd headed into the courtyard, his stride purposeful but slow. As he reached the centre of the courtyard, the Aryn gasped as the <em>weave</em> was suddenly disturbed, and four armed warriors appeared from nowhere to surround the Truthseeker. Impossible! No mage could trace a Cloak of Vision without leaving a disruption in the <em>weave</em>! He watched, horrified, as the warriors charged the Truthseeker... and missed, somehow. Indeed, the youth had seemingly not even noticed the attackers, and yet with each measured step, an attack was effortlessly evaded. One of the strange warriors yelled something in frustration, before his yell turned to a scream as another warrior&#39;s mis-aimed thrust skewered him, blood spraying from the wound in his chest. The orderly ambush quickly disintegrated into a disorganised melee, too quick for Aryn&#39;s vision to follow, but it seemed like only moments before the battle was over, all four warriors lying dead in the courtyard, while Jaræd stood over them, miraculously untouched.</p><p>Aryn was stupified; the Truthseeker had not even been armed! The youth smirked at him, before waving them over into the courtyard.</p><p>&quot;This, Mage, is why I lead, and you follow.&quot;</p><p>Somehow he managed to make the title seem more like an insult. Sighing, the mage bit back an angry retort, and silently moved over to rejoin the Truthseeker. Jaræd gestured at a doorway on the other side of the courtyard.</p><p>&quot;Our prey has gone to ground in that building; one of you guard the entrance, the rest of us will search inside.&quot;<br /></p>
