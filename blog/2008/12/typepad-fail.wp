         <p>After recently discovering that people couldn&#39;t comment anonymously on my blog (apparently Vox just doesn&#39;t support this at all), I started looking around at other blogging platforms again. I decided to start with TypePad, what with it being another SixApart service.</p><p>So, I run through the registration process, only to get a generic &quot;an error occurred&quot; type page at the end of the process, with a &quot;leave a message&quot; form that I filled out. I suspect this may be related to having signed up for TypePad before, and then deleting my account, but who knows.</p><p>I still haven&#39;t had a response to my error report, but I got this e-mail in my inbox just now:</p><blockquote><p>From: TypePad <code>&lt;TypePad@mail.vresp.com&gt;</code><br />Subject: Was it something we said?</p><p>Was it something we said?</p><p>We noticed that you started to register for a TypePad account, but didn’t complete it.</p><p>Maybe the doorbell rang. Maybe you were late for a meeting.</p><p>Or maybe it was us.</p><p>Whatever the reason, we want the chance to show you that we’re quite simply the best hosted blogging service on the market. Just follow the link below and enter code &lt;snip&gt; for a special 10% discount and a 14-day free trial.</p></blockquote><p>Uhm.</p><p>Yeah.</p>
