         <p>People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals... sounds like a worthy cause, right? Sign me up! Unfortunately, the organisation seems to be run by clueless retards. Here are two of the latest examples I&#39;ve run across:<br /></p><p><a href="http://www.helpthaielephants.com/imogen2.html">Torture in Thailand</a>: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imogen_Bailey">Imogen Bailey</a> features in an advertisement protesting cruel elephant &quot;training&quot; techniques in Thailand. In the ad, we have the eminent Ms. Bailey looking like a playful submissive dressed, err, undressed for a bondage shoot; this is an advert /against/ elephant torture?<br /></p><p><a href="http://www.humanbatterycage.com/gallery">Human Battery Cage</a>: Ah yes, the battery cage, bane of hapless chickens everywhere. From the site:</p><blockquote><p>The Human Battery Cage is a unique piece of installation/performance

art designed to show the public, in a vivid and realistic way, the

cramped conditions caged birds are subjected to for the production of

eggs for human consumption.</p></blockquote><p>Right, so, they have a nice gallery full of people sitting in the cage in these horrific cramped conditions... and every single one of them has a grin so big it looks like The Joker was on makeup duty for the day. Hello?</p><p>Basically, it seems like PETA don&#39;t care what message they send, as long as people get the message; this seems to completely defeat the point of trying to send a message in the first place.<br /></p>
