        <p>Please find enclosed an updated version of Mike Taylor&#39;s FAQ, &quot;<a href="http://www.miketaylor.org.uk/tech/wxinmfpl/debian.html">Why Debian Is Not My Favourite Operating System</a>&quot;.</p><ol><li><p>How can I add a package?</p><p>That&#39;s easy! Just use <code>aptitude install <em>package</em>.</code></p></li><li><p>How can I upgrade my installation to the latest version?</p><p>That&#39;s easy! Just use <code>aptitude update; aptitude full-upgrade</code>.</p></li><li><p>How can I search for a package?</p><p>That&#39;s easy! Just use <code>aptitude search <em>keyword</em></code>.</p></li><li><p>How can I reconfigure an already-installed package?</p><p>That&#39;s easy! Just use <code>dpkg-reconfigure <em>package</em></code>. (Sorry, this one still sucks.)</p></li><li><p>How can I get cutting-edge versions of some packages?</p><p>You can upgrade to testing or unstable by replacing your distribution name in /etc/apt/sources.list with one of those keywords, and then following the instructions in FAQ 2. Please be warned that this is not, in general, a reversible operation.</p></li><li><p>How can I keep stable versions of most packages?<br /></p><p>You can&#39;t; mixing and maxing packages from stable with packages from unstable or testing will likely result in insanity, hair loss, and result in a broken system. However, if you want to mostly stick with stable, but want updated versions of a handful of packages, backported versions of many packages are available at <a href="http://backports.org/">backports.org</a>; these are newer versions of packages compiled against the older libraries in stable. See the site for more information on how to make use of backports.</p></li><li><p>Why is php4 deleted when I install netpbm?<br /></p><p>It isn&#39;t. However, when trying to diagnose other issues of this kind, you can use <code>aptitude why <em>package</em></code> to tell you why a certain package is required, and <code>aptitude why-not <em>package</em></code> to tell you why a certain package conflicts with other packages if you try to install it.</p></li><li><p>Why can&#39;t I reinstall PHP4?<br /></p><p>You can, but see FAQ 7 for more information about similar issues.<br /></p></li><li><p>How can I downgrade my system back to stable?<br /></p><p>You can&#39;t. While you can attempt to downgrade any individual package by forcing the package manager to select an older version (for example, <code>aptitude install <em>package=version</em></code>), downgrades are explicitly not supported, and trying to downgrade masses of packages at once, or downgrade a package to a much older version, will likely result in failure and a broken system.<br /></p></li><li><p>How can I fix ``also in package&#39;&#39; errors?</p><p>Don&#39;t downgrade. If you got this error while doing something else, report a bug.<br /></p></li><li><p>How can I fix another, seemingly identical, error?<br /></p><p>Seriously, no downgrades!</p></li><li><p>How can I fix yet another, also seemingly identical, error?<br /></p><p>I mean it, no downgrades!<br /></p></li><li><p>How can I fix all the other similar errors?<br /></p><p>Seriously, I&#39;m not even joking.<br /></p></li><li><p>So how the hell are you supposed to downgrade?<br /></p><p>You&#39;re not!<br /></p></li><li><p>What&#39;s the relationship between apt, dpkg and dselect?</p><p><em>dpkg</em> is the low level tool for manipulating Debian packages. <em>apt</em> is a library that provides additional functionality on top of <em>dpkg</em>, such as locating and downloading packages on demand, and performing dependency analysis to install dependencies at the same time. <em>apt-get</em> is a basic <em>apt</em> frontend usable from the command-line. <em>aptitude</em> is a more advanced <em>apt</em> frontend which is usable from the command-line as well as having an <em>ncurses</em> GUI. There are also a variety of other package management frontends, such as <em>synaptic</em>. <em>dselect</em> is an ancient <em>dpkg</em> frontend that basically nobody uses anymore; if you don&#39;t know what it is, then forget you ever heard about it.</p></li><li><p>Remind me again how easy Debian makes package-management?</p><p>Well, Debian&#39;s far from perfect, it&#39;s just better than everything else. *g*<br /></p></li></ol>
