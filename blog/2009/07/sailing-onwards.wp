Other projects going back on the shelf include <a href="https://launchpad.net/kali">Kali</a> (the replacement services package being developed for <a href="http://shadowfire.org/">Shadowfire</a>), <a href="http://trac.slipgate.za.net/eridanus">Eridanus</a> (an IRC bot based on <a href="http://divmod.org/trac/wiki/DivmodMantissa">Mantissa</a> and <a href="http://twistedmatrix.com/">Twisted</a> to which I haven&#39;t contributed much besides design advice), <a href="https://launchpad.net/txAWS">txAWS</a> (a Twisted library wrapping Amazon Web Services APIs), <a href="https://launchpad.net/txSmug">txSmug</a> (a Twisted library wrapping <a href="http://www.smugmug.com/">SmugMug</a>&#39;s API), and <a href="http://qdb.slipgate.za.net/">FlyingCircus</a> (an IRC quote database based on Mantissa).<br /></p><p>What does being &quot;shelved&quot; entail? Well, firstly, it doesn&#39;t mean that I&#39;m giving up completely on any of these projects, burning the source code, or refusing to ever work on them ever again. It does mean that I won&#39;t actively be thinking about or working on any of these projects; I might be persuaded to help someone out who&#39;s interested in taking over from me, but otherwise they&#39;re getting kicked out of my mental space to make room for working on other things.</p><p>This isn&#39;t necessarily the kiss of death for any of these projects; Dosage will slowly degrade over time, I guess, but maybe someone else will step up to the plate. Eridanus never really got any contributions from me, and the existing functionality isn&#39;t going to suddenly break. txAWS and txSmug are far from complete, but if you don&#39;t need anything beyond what they already provide, they&#39;re perfectly usable, and txAWS has other developers that may provide further contributions. Finally, FlyingCircus is pretty much &quot;complete&quot;; there&#39;s always room for improvement on any piece of software, of course, but it&#39;s perfectly usable as-is.</p><p>So, what <em>am</em> I going to be working on? Well, as always, most/all of my projects make use of Twisted and Divmod, and I&#39;ll continue contributing changes to those projects based on requirements of my own projects. Methanal is another project that falls into this category; and as a dependency / spin-off of the code base I work on for my day job, it&#39;ll probably keep ticking along. I&#39;m not planning to package any new software for Debian, but I&#39;ll probably keep maintaining the software I&#39;m already involved with, since there&#39;s not a huge amount of effort involved.</p><p>The &quot;big one&quot; is probably going to be <a href="http://edgeverse.com/">EdgeVerse</a>. In case you couldn&#39;t make any sense of the useless description on the website, or were too lazy to visit it, EdgeVerse is a project that&#39;s basically all about tracking media: books, movies, music, TV series, whatever. This includes tracking what you already own and have watched, tracking new releases that you&#39;re interested in, and of course tracking all of your friends too. It&#39;s ultimately a pretty ambitious project, and I&#39;m not at all confident that it&#39;ll be able to succeed, but for now I&#39;m going to be giving it a try (hopefully).</p><p>I&#39;ll no doubt be posting more about EdgeVerse in the days and weeks to come; if you&#39;re curious about the status of any project I haven&#39;t mentioned here, feel free to inquire in the comments, or by <a href="mailto:mithrandi@mithrandi.net">email</a> / <a>IRC</a> / <a href="http://friendfeed.com/mithrandi">FriendFeed</a> / whatever.<br /></p>
