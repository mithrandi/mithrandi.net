        <p>Zed Shaw of, well, internet fame (or infamy?) recently <a href="http://zedshaw.com/blog/2009-07-13.html">posted about the GPL</a>, and why he uses it as the license for his software. I understand his reasoning, and I think I even agree that the GPL is the best way to achieve his goals; however, for my own work, I strongly feel that other issues take priority over the ones he raises.</p><p>For starters, there are practical issues with the GPL. The biggest of these is simply the fact that it is a copyleft license; by their very nature, any two copyleft licenses are either legally equivalent, or incompatible, and so this just doesn&#39;t scale. Even the GPL v2 is mutually incompatible with the GPL v3, which has presented some people with some unexpected nasty surprises. This kind of compatibility barrier causes non-trivial damage to the Free Software ecosystem.</p><p>Another main benefit of Free Software projects is that the community is not isolated into silos; everyone can freely mingle as they choose, collaborating on changes and so on., and this even extends to developers working on proprietary software projects. The GPL + proprietary model breaks this; the companies that have to purchase a proprietary license are effectively isolated from everyone else due to the nature of those licenses, and so they&#39;re likely to just stay locked behind closed doors, rather than supporting the project through interaction and contribution.</p><p>So, my motivations and reasoning are quite different from Zed&#39;s. I don&#39;t want to build a shrine to my awesomeness that all passers by can see; I don&#39;t have any objection to that goal at all, it&#39;s just not something that motivates me. I don&#39;t want recognition or credit for the work I do on my projects; I won&#39;t object to any kudos I receive, of course, but ultimately I just want those projects to succeed, even if it&#39;s at the cost of my own ego or fame. On the flip side, making use of GPLed code, even in my own Free Software projects, presents such a significant burden that I&#39;m likely to think very hard about whether the dependency is worth it, rather than just recreating what I need on my own. I&#39;m not sure that Zed&#39;s model of Free Software or &quot;open source&quot; projects is actually something that can survive in the long run; we need to play to our strengths, not our weaknesses...<br /></p><p>Oh, in passing, I&#39;d like to add that I&#39;m very happy to tell people about how awesome the other projects I rely on are, and in fact I do so quite often; not all of us are &quot;plagiarists&quot;, even if it looks that way to Zed. Then again, I don&#39;t (yet?) use any software he&#39;s created, so I guess that doesn&#39;t help him, although I still have a lot of respect for what he&#39;s accomplished.<br /></p>
