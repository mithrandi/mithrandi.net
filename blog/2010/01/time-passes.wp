Since then, I&#39;ve not actually paid much attention to matters of health at all, and they haven&#39;t intruded on me either; I&#39;ve also spent the last few weeks with my family in Cape Town, doing pretty much nothing, just getting away from it all. Having a chance to step back, relax, and look at things from a clear perspective has allowed me to make some decisions which will probably ease my stress levels in the future, although I can&#39;t really discuss those here and now.</p><p>In other news, I&#39;ve finally gotten around to the last step of migrating <a href="https://launchpad.net/dosage">Dosage</a> development to Launchpad: the source repository has now been converted to bzr. I&#39;ve also started the process of going through the outstanding contributions and either integrating or discarding them, so I guess you could call that progress.</p><p><a href="http://jonathanj.vox.com/">Jonathan</a> has been doing some awesome work on a new tab widget in Methanal, which will serve as a vastly improved replacement for Nevow&#39;s &quot;tabbed pane&quot; widget, as soon as somebody (ie. me) gets around to reviewing the code.</p><p>And... more later.<br /></p>
