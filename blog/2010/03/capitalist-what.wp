For some reason that I cannot fathom, I am currently #9 on a Google search for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=capitalist+pigs">capitalist pigs</a>, and #7 for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22capitalist+pigs%22">"capitalist pigs"</a>. I first noticed this a couple of weeks back, but I now find that Google searches for capitalist pigs are the leading source of visits to this blog. WTF? I'm guessing that someone googlebombed me using another URL that redirects to my website; anyone have any ideas how to track this down? I honestly don't really care about it, except now I'm so damned curious that I'm about to die of curiosity.
