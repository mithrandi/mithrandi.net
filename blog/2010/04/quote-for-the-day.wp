<blockquote>The discovery of this reality is hindered rather than helped by  belief, whether one believes in God or believes in atheism. We must make  here a clear distinction between belief and faith, because, in general  practice, belief has come to mean a state of mind which is almost the  opposite of faith. Belief, as I use the word here, is the insistence  that the truth is what one would “lief” or wish it to be. The believer  will open his mind to the truth on the condition that it fits in with  his preconceived ideas and wishes. Faith, on the other hand, is an  unreserved opening of the mind to the truth, whatever it may turn out to  be. Faith has no preconceptions; it is a plunge into the unknown.  Belief clings, but faith lets go. In this sense of the word, faith is  the essential virtue of science, and likewise of any religion that is  not self-deception. – Alan Watts</blockquote>

That's all for now, but I have a few other blog posts in the pipeline.
