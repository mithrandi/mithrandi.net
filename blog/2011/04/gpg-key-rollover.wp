I have finally gotten around to generating a new GPG key. See <a href="http://mithrandi.net/gpg-key-transition-2011-04-07.txt">this signed message</a> for details. My old key had exactly one signature from somebody that wasn't me, and I'd like to do better with my new key; if you have the ability to verify my identity, please get in touch with me in order to arrange keysigning!
