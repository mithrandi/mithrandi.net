I'm now a Debian Developer. Woot! And it only took me just <a href="https://nm.debian.org/public/nmstatus/mithrandi">6 years and 17 days</a>... although the overwhelming majority of the delay was due to my own lack of time / energy, rather than anyone else's fault. On a related matter, my <a href="http://pool.sks-keyservers.net:11371/pks/lookup?search=0x58C0FB1CDE3B7600&amp;fingerprint=on&amp;hash=on&amp;op=vindex">newish PGP key</a> is sadly lacking in signatures. If you're in or travelling to Johannesburg / Gauteng area in South Africa and want to exchange signatures, please get in touch (especially if you're a Debian Developer or Debian Maintainer, but even if you're not).
